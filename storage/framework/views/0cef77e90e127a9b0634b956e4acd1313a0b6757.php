        <div data-theme-editor-setting="section.feature-row.text">
          <p>abc came to be because of three friends who had a vision of   becoming successful entrepreneurs, while also providing a service that   is beneficial to the community. The&nbsp;three of us met the first week of   college and became friends shortly after. Our friendship was based on   our shared faith, baseball, and our dreams of becoming entrepreneurs. We   spent hours brainstorming in the cafeteria of a solution to some sort   of problem in our community. We were all on the same page that we were   your typical "broke college students".&nbsp; We wanted to provide services to   students to help save money, and then we&nbsp;came up with the idea of   abc. From there we worked on creating a business model so that   we could effectively provide this service to as many students as   possible. Through hard work and vigorous amounts of student feedback and   research, we launched abc!</p>
